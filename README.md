# Campus Lost & Found — AI-Powered Management System

An AI-enhanced campus lost-and-found platform. Students report lost/found items with a photo, an intelligent pipeline detects objects, reads image similarity and extracts text attributes, and a hybrid matcher surfaces likely matches. Owners can submit a claim, which admins review and approve to mark an item as recovered.

## Problem

Items are lost on campus every day. Reports are scattered across notice boards and group chats, matching is manual, and there is no central review or recovery workflow.

## Solution

One platform where:

- Students/finders report items with photos and details.
- An AI pipeline analyzes every report automatically.
- A hybrid matching engine ranks lost/found pairs by relevance.
- Claimants submit claims with a private verification detail.
- Admins review claims, approve/reject, delete reports and track recovery — behind a password-protected login.

## Main Features

- Lost & Found report forms with photo upload (JPG/PNG/WEBP/GIF, max 5 MB)
- Real-time report grid with search + category/location/status filters
- Smart Match Engine tab showing high-confidence pairs with human-readable reasons
- Claim flow: claimant name + email + private verification detail (e.g. distinguishing feature, contents, marking)
- Admin dashboard: view reports, view pending claims, approve/reject claims, delete reports, mark recovered, live statistics
- Admin authentication (credentials from environment variables, server-side protected routes, logout)
- Optional real YOLOv8 + CLIP integration

## AI Architecture

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **YOLOv8** (`yolov8n.onnx`, run via ONNX Runtime Node) | Real-time object detection. Detects objects in report photos and generates object labels + confidence + bounding boxes. |
| **CLIP** (ViT-B/32 via `@xenova/transformers`) | Visual similarity. Produces 512-dim image embeddings; cosine similarity between lost/found photos feeds the image-similarity score. |
| **NLP / Text attribute extraction** | Extracts keywords, colors, brands, features and location hints from report descriptions. |
| **Hybrid matching engine** | Weighted scoring: category 30%, description keywords 25%, location 15%, date proximity 10%, detected object overlap 10%, image similarity 10%. Emits per-rule explanations. |

All AI output is real inference — no fake/stubbed results. If a heavy runtime is missing, the pipeline reports its availability per item instead of failing.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js + Express
- **Database:** MongoDB via Mongoose (optional) or built-in JSON file store (`data/db.json`)
- **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML/CSS (Tailwind via CDN) served by Express
- **AI:** ONNX Runtime Node (`yolov8n.onnx`), `@xenova/transformers` (CLIP ViT-B/32), custom regex/keyword extraction
- **Media:** `sharp` for image processing, `multer` for uploads

```

## Installation

Requirements: Node.js 18+.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The server runs at **http://localhost:5000**.

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust. Never commit `.env`.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `PORT` | Server port (default `5000`) |
| `MONGO_URI` | Mongo connection string. Leave empty to use the JSON file store. |
| `DB_FILE` | JSON store path (default `./data/db.json`) |
| `UPLOAD_DIR` | Where uploaded images are stored (default `./uploads`) |
| `IMG_MAX_MB` | Max upload size in MB (default `5`) |
| `EMBEDDINGS_ENABLED` | `true` enables CLIP image embeddings |
| `DETECTION_ENABLED` | `true` enables YOLOv8 object detection |
| `DETECTION_MODEL` | Path to the YOLO `.onnx` model (default `./models/yolov8n.onnx`) |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` | Admin login username |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Admin login password |

## YOLO Object Detection Model

`yolov8n.onnx` is included in this repository (~13MB, well within GitHub's file size limit).

If you need to fetch it fresh instead (e.g. corrupt/missing model):

```
# PowerShell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v0.0.0/yolov8n.onnx" -OutFile "models/yolov8n.onnx"
```

For other YOLO ONNX exports, export from Ultralytics: `yolo export model=yolov8n.pt format=onnx`.

## Running the Application

1. `npm install`
2. Create `.env` from `.env.example` (set `EMBEDDINGS_ENABLED=true` and `DETECTION_ENABLED=true` for full AI).
3. `npm start`
4. Open http://localhost:5000
5. Check the API: http://localhost:5000/api/health returns `{"ok":true}`.

### Admin Login Setup

- Set `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in your `.env` (any values you choose — change them before deploying).
- Restart the server.
- Open the **Admin** tab at http://localhost:5000 and log in with those credentials.
- Sessions expire after 12 hours; use the Logout button when done.

## Deployment (Render Web Service — backend for the GitHub Pages frontend)

GitHub Pages can only host static files (it returns **405** for POST requests), so the Express backend must be deployed separately. Render's free tier is a good fit for this demo.

1. Create a **Web Service** on [render.com](https://render.com) connected to this repository:
   - **Repository:** `https://github.com/RishabhDhillon/findit_ai`
   - **Build command:** `npm install`
   - **Start command:** `npm start`
   - Node 18+ is selected automatically from the `engines` field in `package.json`.
2. Set the required environment variables in the Render dashboard:

   | Variable | Value | Purpose |
   |----------|-------|---------|
   | `ADMIN_USERNAME` | `admin` | Admin login username |
   | `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | (choose a strong one) | Admin login password |
   | `EMBEDDINGS_ENABLED` | `false` | CLIP downloads ~350MB of models — too heavy for the free tier |
   | `DETECTION_ENABLED` | `false` | Keep the demo light; can be enabled later (`yolov8n.onnx` ships in the repo) |
   | `DB_FILE` | `./data/db.json` | JSON store location |
   | `UPLOAD_DIR` | `./uploads` | Where uploaded photos are stored |
   | `IMG_MAX_MB` | `5` | Max upload size |
   | `MONGO_URI` | *(empty)* | Leave empty to use the JSON store; set an Atlas URI for a durable database |
   | `PORT` | *(Render assigns one)* | Server port |

3. Configure the **health check** path as `/api/health` (Render polls it to consider the service healthy).
4. After Render assigns the service URL (e.g. `https://findit-api.onrender.com`), point the static frontend at it: in `public/index.html`, find the `API CONFIGURATION` block and set `const PRODUCTION_API_URL = 'https://findit-api.onrender.com';`. Push to `main` and GitHub Pages redeploys `public/` automatically.
5. `DB_FILE` (the JSON database) and `UPLOAD_DIR` (uploaded photos) live on the server's **ephemeral disk**. On the free/demo deployment the instance sleeps when idle and its disk is recreated on restart, so **reports, claims and photos are lost**. For persistent data, set `MONGO_URI` to a free MongoDB Atlas cluster (the DB becomes durable; uploaded files stay ephemeral unless you later add cloud storage).

## Demo Workflow

1. Student reports a **Lost** item with a photo.
2. Finder reports a **Found** item with a photo.
3. The AI pipeline runs per item: YOLO object detection → CLIP image embedding → text attribute extraction.
4. The Smart Match Engine ranks pairs; matched items show a score and reasons (category, keywords, location, date, object, image similarity).
5. The claimant opens the item's **Contact** modal and submits a claim with a verification detail.
6. Admin logs in, reviews the pending claim in the Admin tab.
7. Admin approves → the item's status changes to **Recovered** and dashboard statistics update.
